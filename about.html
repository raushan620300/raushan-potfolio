                                <p>Initially, I had little idea about the world of coding. It wasn't something I had planned or imagined myself doing. However, a friend introduced me to the field and encouraged me to explore it. Out of curiosity, I decided to give it a try ‚Äî and it turned out to be a life-changing decision. As I started learning the basics, I found myself genuinely enjoying the logic, creativity, and problem-solving involved. That first step, inspired by a friend's suggestion, marked the beginning of my journey into the exciting world of technology and programming.</p>

                                <p>After chose Coding career, I decided to pursue higher studies in the field of technology. I enrolled in the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) program at Maharaja College, affiliated with Veer Kunwar Singh University (VKSU), Arrah. Choosing BCA was a turning point for me, as it provided a strong foundation in computer science, programming, and software development. Throughout my college journey, I gained not only academic knowledge but also developed skills, discipline, and a deeper passion for the world of technology.</p>

                                <p>I began my coding journey during college with C++ and Java, which helped me build a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Through consistent practice, I developed strong problem-solving skills that laid the foundation for my technical growth. Later, I discovered a strong interest in Frontend Development and started learning HTML and CSS. I focused on building responsive and interactive web pages, bringing ideas to life through projects like login forms, personal portfolios, calculators, and a Ludo game. These practical experiences not only improved my frontend skills but also sparked a deeper passion for creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. I also use <strong><a href="https://vercel.com/raushan620300s-projects">Vercel</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></strong> for deploying my Projects.</p>

                                <p>As I continued my journey in web development, I took the next step by learning JavaScript to enhance the interactivity and functionality of my websites. This allowed me to build fully responsive and dynamic projects like VirtuoX, Sendify, Portfolio, and TechStorm‚Äîmy personal website. With a growing passion for development, I'm currently expanding my skillset by learning the React library for building scalable user interfaces, and working with modern styling frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. On the backend side, I've started working with MySQL to understand database integration. My ultimate goal is to become a proficient Full Stack Developer, capable of building complete web applications from front to back. I posted my all completed projects and websites in <a href="" id="projectsLink"><strong>Projects</strong></a> section.

                    <p>Hi there, I‚Äôm Raushan Sinha. I'm a passionate Frontend Developer üë®‚Äçüíª. I enjoy building websites with Responsive Web Design ‚Äî it makes me feel creative üöÄ.</p>
                    <p>I have frontend skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+), along with libraries and frameworks like React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. I‚Äôve built several projects using this tech stack, such as ‚ÄòVirtuoX - AI Assistant‚Äô, ‚ÄòSendify Login Form‚Äô, ‚ÄòPortfolio‚Äô, and my personal website ‚ÄòTechStorm‚Äô. I also use AI to create websites because, in this generation, having AI skills is essential for a better future in development. <br> I‚Äôm currently learning databases like MySQL, and after completing that, I‚Äôll move on to backend tools like Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to secure my future in full stack development.
                    Once I complete both frontend and backend, I‚Äôll transition from being a Frontend Developer to a Full Stack Developer üë®‚Äçüíª, because full stack roles are more valuable and offer higher-paying opportunities than frontend roles alone.</p>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I'm passionate about creating digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional. I believe in the power of clean code and thoughtful design to transform ideas into reality.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not in front of my Laptop, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs or contributing to the developer community. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push me outside my comfort zone. I read Tech related articles and post my written articles and blogs on <strong>Dev Community</strong> and <strong>Daily.dev</strong>.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to continue growing as a developer and designer, creating meaningful projects that make a positive impact on users' lives. I create several websites and projects after that I post them <strong>GitHub</strong>, <strong>Vercel</strong>, <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and <strong>X</strong> because I think these social icons are very helpful to show your skills to someone and find the work employees who can see your skills or experience and then they can give you an opportunity to work in the company.</p>
